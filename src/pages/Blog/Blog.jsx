            <p>
              In React, controlled components refer to components that have
              their state and behavior controlled by the parent component. These
              components rely on props passed down from the parent component to
              update their state and behavior. Uncontrolled components refer to
              components that manage their own state internally.

            How to validate React props using PropTypes?
          </div>
          <div className="collapse-content bg-cyan-50">
            <p>
              PropTypes is a feature in React that allows you to validate the
              data types of props passed to your components. To use PropTypes,
              you first need to import the module from the 'prop-types' package.
              Then, you can define a PropTypes object in your component and
              assign it to the 'propTypes' property of the component. The
              PropTypes object contains keys representing the prop names, and
              values representing the expected types of the props. You can use
              PropTypes to validate props passed to your component, and if a
              prop is not of the expected type, a warning will be displayed in
              the console. PropTypes can be used for a variety of data types
              including strings, numbers, booleans, objects, and arrays.
              PropTypes can also be used to specify that a prop is required by
              adding the 'isRequired' modifier. Additionally, PropTypes can be
              used to specify more complex data structures like objects with
              specific shape and nesting. It's important to note that PropTypes
              validation is only performed in development mode, so it will not
              impact performance in production. Overall, PropTypes is a useful
              tool for catching errors and ensuring that your component receives
              the expected data types and shapes for its props.

            What is the difference between Node.js and Express.js?
          </div>
          <div className="collapse-content bg-cyan-50">
            <p>
              Node.js is a server-side runtime environment for executing
              JavaScript code, while Express.js is a framework built on top of
              Node.js that simplifies the process of building web applications.
              Node.js provides a platform for running JavaScript code on the
              server, while Express.js provides a set of tools and abstractions
              that make it easier to handle HTTP requests, routing, and
              middleware in Node.js applications. In essence, Node.js is a
              foundation for building server-side applications, while Express.js
              is a higher-level tool that simplifies the process of building web
              applications on top of Node.js.

            What is a custom hook, and why will you create a custom hook?
          </div>
          <div className="collapse-content bg-cyan-50">
            <p>
              A custom hook is a JavaScript function that allows you to reuse
              stateful logic across multiple React components. Custom hooks are
              created to avoid repeating the same logic in multiple components
              and to keep the logic separated from the rendering concerns of the
              components. Custom hooks can be used to encapsulate complex logic,
              handle side effects, or abstract API calls. Essentially, custom
              hooks help to keep code organized, reduce duplication, and make it
              easier to reuse code across multiple components.
